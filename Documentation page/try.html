      <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
      <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>This guide assumes you have the following basic background:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>
        <li>Good working knowledge of HyperText Markup Language (HTML).</li>
        <li>Some programming experience. If you are new to programming, try one of the tutorials linked on the main page about JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
      <header id="Hello_world">Hello world</header>
      <p>To get started with writing JavaScript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello world" JavaScript code:</p>
      <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
        greetMe("World");</code>
      <p>Select the code in the pad and hit Ctrl+R to watch it unfold in your browser!</p>
    </section>

      <header id="Declaring_variables">Declaring variables</header>
      <p>You can declare a variable in three ways:</p>
      <p>With the keyword var. For example,</p>
      <code>var x = 42.</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.</p>
      <p>By simply assigning it a value. For example,</p>
      <code>x = 42.</code>
      <p>This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.</p>
      <p>With the keyword let. For example,</p>
      <code>let y = 13.</code>
      <p>This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope below.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
      <header id="Variable_scope">Variable scope</header>
      <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a global variable, because it is available to any other code in the current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is called a local variable, because it is available only within that function.

      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope; rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case is an if statement.
      </p>
      <code>if (true) { var x = 5; } console.log(x); // 5
      </code>
      <p>This behavior changes, when using the let declaration introduced in ECMAScript 2015.</p>
      <code>if (true) { let y = 5; } console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is
        not defined</code>
